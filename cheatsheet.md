# Vim

 * General commands:
 * `R` - replace mode (insert mode but overwriting)
   * `q:` open command list of previous commands, can modify them and rerun by hitting `<CR>`
   * `q/` same as above for search history (`<CTRL>C` to quit command list)
   * `<CTRL>I, <CTRL>O` move forwards, backwards through jumplist
   * `:args **/*.mjs` load all js files into the args list
   * `:argdo %s/'src/'lib/gi | update` do a search and replace in all files in the args list
   * `:argdo normal @a` execute the macro in register a on all files in the args list
 * the power of g:
   * `:g/regex/norm wdw`: for all lines that match the regex execute the normal commands: (example will delete the second word)
 * Renaming variables:
   * `gd` - goto definition, then
   * `[{` - jump to scope that wraps the definition
   * `v%` - visually select whole scope
   * `:s/var/newvar/g` - within selection do the replacement
   * NOTE: `gr` will do all above and land in the `:s` command waiting for you to type your new variable name
 * `ReaderMode` and `ReaderModeOff` - distraction free writing using `Goyo` and `Limelight`
   * `{` and `}` for next and previous paragraph
 * startify: `SSave` and `SSLoad` for sessions
 * `g>` or `g<` or `gs` - vim-swap arguments for reordering arguments
 * table mode: ` tm` toggle table mode - then markdown tables will auto-align on pipes. `||` will create horizontal line
 * diffing/merging:
   * `GetLeft` or `:diffget //2` get left changes
   * `GetRight` or `:diffget //3` get right changes
   * `GetRemote` or `:diffget RE` get remote changes
   * `GetLocal` or `:diffget LO` get local changes
   * `GetBase` or `:diffget BA` get base changes
   * `NextChange` or `]c` move to next change
   * `PreviousChange` or `[c` move to previous change
 * Terminal mode:
   * `terminal` to enter terminal mode
   * `i` to enter and `ESC` to leave
 * Fugitive:
   * `Gwrite` writes to disk + to index (like git add on working tree file or like checkout for history)
   * `Gdiff` show side by side diff between staged and working tree
   * `Gmove` does a git mv on file + renames buffer
   * `Gdelete` does a git rm on file + deletes buffer

   * `Gcommit` git commit (will bring up buffer to write message)
   * `GitPull` to pull changes
   * `GitPush` to push changes
 * Linting:
   * Neomake should lint on changes for eslint by default using local eslint install
   *  `<leader>j` to write,eslint fix,read current buffer
 * Expression register
   * `<C>r` in insert mode to e.g. do arithmetic: `<C>r=2+2` will insert `4`
   * `"=` in normal mode e.g. past in local timestamp: `"=strftime("%c")<CR>p"
   * when in command line to paste a register use `<C>r"` e.g. if the word foo is in the default register, replace foo with bar in whole document like: `%s/<C>r"/bar/g`
   * `Sum` will take a sum (ending in a space) and replace it in the buffer with the answer
 * Easy motion:
   * `<leader>s` move to char char in all visible buffers
   * `<leader>c` move to character in all visible buffers
   * `<leader>w` move to word in all visible buffers
   * `<leader>l` move to line in all visible buffers
   * `<leader><leader>sx` move to character x in view in current buffer
   * `<leader><leader>w` move to word from cursor or `b` behind cursor in current buffer
 * FZF - fuzzy file searcher
   * `<leader>p` or `CTRL-P` maps to GFiles - fuzzy filename searcher in whole of git repo
   * `Files PATH` search in all folders from cwd
   * `GFiles PATH` search in tracked folders from git root
   * `Commits` search through commits
   * `BCommits` search through commits for the current buffer
